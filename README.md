This is the repository for a discord bot, one of my first python projects.

Its actually insane. Theres so much functionality in this bot. Like, I put EVERYTHING i knew into it for like 8 months. Actually though. Skim the code in the SCP folder. Its really cool. I thought it was just another thing back then, but looking back at it, its amazing. Its not deployed anymore, my computer got older lol

I even made a webapp that communicated with this bot through interprocess communication. The webapp source code is here:
